pystemm
=======

PySTEMM is a tool and model library for building executable concept models using a functional-programming style (immutable objects and pure functions). See EuroSciPy 2013 proceedings for a paper with details.

PySTEMM requires these open-source modules to be installed:
- traits (Enthoughts Traits)
- inflect (for narrative text generation)
- appscript (for AppleScript interface to drawing app)
- inspect (to manipulate classes, methods, source code)
- numpy, pylab (for numerical integration, graph plots)
- pylpsolve (for integer linear programming solver)

Visualization requires OmnigrafflePro on OSX.
